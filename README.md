# Data-analysis-project-with-PowerBI

The aim of the virtual case study is to investigate which characteristics of the population are more likely to have a stroke. The report concludes with practical recommendations for effective stroke prevention (reducing the risk of stroke) based on the results of the visualisation and data analysis.

After fully understanding the significance and interconnectedness of the data in the data table (csv file), the visualisation and analysis of each data type using PowerBI virtual desktop was carried out with a hypothetical project objective and case study. The discussion and analysis of the visualisation results is then completed in the form of a report (word file).
